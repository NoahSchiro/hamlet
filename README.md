HAskell Machine LEarning and Training.

This library serves as a general purpose machine learning toolkit written in pure haskell with minimal dependencies (currently with no outside dependencies).

Currently this library is in an unusable state. As features are added and adequately tested, the following list will be updated. Each model type will also include information about it's performance in comparison to other popular machine learning tools.

- [ ] kNN classifier
- [ ] Naive Bayes Classifier
- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Artificial Neural Networks
- [ ] Boltzman Machines
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning

These componenents will be completed in the order listed above (most likely).
